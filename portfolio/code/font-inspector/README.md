# Chrome Extension - Font Inspector 

This is a simple chrome extension is made to inspect font styles on websites. While it is possible to inspect web fonts using firebug, the process is not user friendly nor is it effective for small tasks. 

I made this extension for personal use and you can see example of it through example.png screen grab.

To use this extension, you'll need to download all the files and set it up through "Tools > Extensions" on Chrome. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button, select the folder that contains downloaded files and select OK. For more information, please [read Google's documentation](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html#load). 

2013 Latest Update:

I realized Google has [deprecated chrome.extension.sendRequest](https://codereview.chromium.org/9965005/). Updating the extension to use with their latest API.
