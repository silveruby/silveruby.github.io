	<section>
		<p>The Georgia Aquarium is the largest Aquarium in the world and it was preparing to open a new Dolphin exhibit (in 2010). In order to market this new opening, they sponsored artists to design artworks on 5' feet tall fiber-glass dolphin statues. The completed statues (including this one!) were displayed throughout the city. Instead of painting a dolphin, our team decided to create an educational and interactive dolphin for the visually impaired users.</p>	
		<p>This was a collaborative project with students from different fields such as Music Technology and Industrial Design. Together, we designed, tested and outfitted touch sensors on the statue.</p>	
		<p>Each member in the team contributed greatly to the project. I <strong>contributed to the user research</strong> and <strong>implemented on the micro-controller (Adruino)</strong> with another student for the music interaction.</p>

		<p>During the first phase of the project, we worked with both people from the Georgia Aquarium and the Center for Visually Impaired (CVI) to better understand and define the users, requirements and environment. These three attributes greatly influenced our design process.</p>
		<p>We went to CVI and did two 1 hour focus group sessions with the users.</p>
		<p>A basic prototype (5 foot tall cardboard dolphin) was built for the second focus group session. </p>
