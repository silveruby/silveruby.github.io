				<div id='process_h' class='heading'><h2>User-Centered Design</h2></div>		
				<div id='process_c' class='content'><div class='content_style'>
					<p>For this design exercise, I would like to use the User-Center Design (UCD) approach. I think understanding the users and designing for their needs should be primary focus and UCD is the best way to accomplish these goals. There are many variations on UCD and for this particular design exercise, I decided to break the schedule into the following five phases: research, concept, implementation, evaluation and finally product release. </p>
				</div></div>
				
				<div id='phase_1h' class='heading'><h3>Phase 1: Research (2 weeks)</h3></div>		
				<div id='phase_1c' class='content'><div class='content_style'>
					<li>Questionnaires</li>						
					<li>Personas</li>					
					<li>Scenarios</li>
					<li>Requirement & Constraints</li>						
					<li>Existing Systems</li>			
					<p>The first thing is to create a general questionnaire. This questionnaire can be a online survey asking about user eating preferences, needs and behaviors.</p>							
					<p>Developing personas and scenarios are important steps to understanding the users. We can use the data from the questionnaire for both Persona and Scenarios. Next, defining the requirement & constraints of the system should be carried out as well. The goal is to find a good balance between user needs and system features.</p>		
					<p>Analyzing existing systems will give designers good concepts and ideas of what are good and bad design choices. Especially if there are plethora of similar systems that are already popular with users.</p>																																																		
				</div></div>

				<div id='phase_2h' class='heading'><h3>Phase 2: Design Concepts (3 weeks)</h3></div>		
				<div id='phase_2c' class='content'><div class='content_style'>
					<li>Interaction</li>
					<li>Wireframes</li>
					<li>Three Design Concepts</li>		
					<li>User Evaluation</li>																			
					<p>Defining interaction, creating multiple wireframes, and design alternatives will help to solidify important concepts.</p>
					<p>I think at least three main design concepts for the system should be created. These three design concepts should be different from each other. The final design should be chosen, if possible, with the users involved. </p>										
				</div></div>
			
				<div id='phase_3h' class='heading'><h3>Phase 3: Implementation (3 weeks)</h3></div>		
				<div id='phase_3c' class='content'><div class='content_style'>
					<li>Final Design</li>
					<li>Implementation</li>	
					<p>Once a final design is selected, the team will need to work together to implement a functional system.</p>																
				</div></div>
			
				<div id='phase_4h' class='heading'><h3>Phase 4: Evaluation (2 weeks)</h3></div>		
				<div id='phase_4c' class='content'><div class='content_style'>
					<li>Usability Testing</li>						
					<li>Iterative Design</li>									
					<p>When the system is complete, it should be release to a small group of users for two weeks to evaluate the system. This will help us find & fix bugs and usability issues.</p>

				<div id='phase_5c' class='content'><div class='content_style'>		
					<li>Release</li>	
					<p>Have a final look at usability usability issues & bugs and then release of the system. Continue support of the system should continue as well even after three months.</p>

						<p>While a website is certainly necessary, I decided to focus on designing for a mobile phone interface. I feel that most users who will use this system should be comfortable with technology and would probably own mobile devices. A mobile application has three advantages over a website: personal privacy, quick on-the-go access and anywhere connectivity.  Users can use this application to not only choose a cafe, they could also connect and share cafe choice with friends through SMS and GPS tracking.</p> 
						<p>I analyzed two existing systems, <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/urbanspoon/id284708449?mt=8' target="_blank">UrbanSpoon</a> and <a href='http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284910350&amp;mt=8' target="_blank">Yelp</a>, to come up with ideas and then created these wireframes.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Menu</strong> - Displays four options and a space for special events. </li>
							<li><strong>Nearby</strong> - Shows all the cafes that are nearby.</li>
							<li><strong>Friends</strong> - Provides updates on where friends are eating.</li>		
							<li><strong>History</strong> - Shows past cafe visits. Also allow users to type in additional notes. </li>	
							<li><strong>Feeling Lucky</strong> - Helps to decide where to eat. This is inspired by UrbanSpoon. I really liked this concept because it is very useful for people who wants to try something random. </li>

					<div id='exercise_mockup'></div>
					<div id='exercise_mockup_content'><div class='content_style'>
						<p>I decided to mockup how information will be displayed for the each Cafe. First of all, for each cafe, there will be four main options located on the bottom of the screen. These options are Today's Menu, Webcam, Meet Up, and Check In. </p> 
						<p>Today's Menu shows the menu (see mockup).</p> 
						<p>Instead of figuring out a way to calculate how crowed the cafe is, I think it would be more useful to allow users to get a live webcam feed of the cafe (see mockup).</p> 
						<p>Meet Up would allow users to notify their friends (from their Friends list)  about their lunch plans. I think we can incorporate Facebook, SMS and/or Twitter in this section. </p> 	
						<p>When users finally figure out where they want to have lunch, they can Check In to add the cafe into history. </p> 
						<p>Only some options are mocked up due to time constraint on this exercise.</p> 															
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Menu</strong> - Displays four options and a space for special events for Charlie's Cafe. </li>
							<li><strong>Menu2</strong> - Shows a detail menu of NAMASTE for Charlie's Cafe.</li>
							<li><strong>Webcam</strong> - Shows a live webcam feed of the cafe. This provide a good estimate about how crowded is the cafe.</li>

					<p><h3>What is CHIMP?</h3></p>
					<p>CHIMP is a collaborative project between Georgia Tech Research Network Operations Center (RNOC) and Motorola. The goal of the platform is to provide widget developers (students) an application development environment for them in which they can create widgets on TV.
					</p>					
					<p>
						<ul>A platform that allows developers to...</ul>
							<ul>
								<ol>Access metadata from video Head-End services</ol>
								<ol>Access third party services on the internet</ol>
								<ol>Control how widgets will be shown</ol>
								<ol>Access the viewing history of the user</ol>

					<p><h3>Exploring Personas</h3></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Passive vs. Active Users</li>													
					</ul>
										
					<p>The first task we did was to understand our users through different types of personas. TV users are very diverse and general so we tried to group them into similar needs and goals. We specifically focused on <em>goals, attitudes, behaviors and interests</em>.</p>	
					<p><h3>Evaluating Existing Systems</h3></p>		
					<ul>
						<li>10-foot UI 'lean back' vs. 2-foot UI 'lean forward'</li>											
					</ul>																
					<p>Interactive TV is a new market and we have not seen a lot of successful implementations on Set-Top Boxes (STB). At the time of the research in 2010, I looked at the following Existing Systems: <em>Yahoo Widgets, Hulu and Boxee.</em></p>											
				</div></div>

				<div id='phase_2c1' class='content'><div class='content_style'>
					
					<p><h3>Stage 1: Defining the Terminologies & Guidelines</h3></p>

					<p><h4>Terminologies for Widgets</h4></p>
															
					<ul>
						<li><strong>View</strong>: the size of a widget</li>	
						<li><a href='./views_grids/views.html' rel='external' target='_blank'>Views Prototype</a></li>																								
					</ul>		

													
					<p>Designing for a TV UI is much different than for a website. Certain differences are screen size, user attention and style of navigation. For initial design, I decided to create some basic guidelines for the size of the widgets.<p> 
					<p>Inspired by an article about good design constrains and <a href='http://www.blueprintcss.org/'>CSS Framework Blueprint</a>, I used a 8x8 grid system to divide up the screen. The grid system was used for the rest of the wireframes and prototypes. It allowed a lot of flexibility for layout styles but also made sure they were consistent and proportional with each other.</p>
					<div id="simplegallery1"></div>
					
					<p><h4>Terminologies for the Platform</h4></p>
																								
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Layout</strong>: the position of the widget(s) on screen</li>	
						<li><strong>Theme</strong>: the style and colors</li>
						<li><strong>Operator User Experience (OUX)</strong>: layout + theme</li>						
					</ul>
										
					<p>Because we were building a platform that will support many widgets, we had to figure out how to maintain a consistent look & feel of it.  This was a big challenge because we had to balance between flexibility for the developers and consistency for the platform. After several rounds of discussion, we came up with a model and these terminologies: layout, theme, and OUX.</p>	
					
					<p><h4>Design Considerations</h4></p>					
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Interlacing</strong> - TV display uses interlacing scan where each frame is made up of two frames. Horizontal lines can flicker or vibrate if they are too thin. Therefore, make sure to create thick horizontal lines.</li>
							<li><strong>Color</strong> - Colors are much more saturated on TV screen than on computer screen. Make sure to use CMYK colors. Extremely vibrant or pale colors can cause problem.</li>	
							<li><strong>Font</strong> - Text should readable from a larger distance (10 feet). Avoid serif font and stick with sans serif or slab serif font. Font size should be no less than 24pt. Avoid red text. Use anti-aliasing for readability.</li>
							<li><strong>Navigation</strong> - Avoid scrolling when possible. Divide contents up if it requires scrolling and make use of panels.</li>													
						</ul>

					<p><h3>Stage 2: Exploring Alternative Designs for Layouts</h3></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Transparency vs. Resizing</li>	
						<li>Multiple vs. Single Widgets</li>					
					</ul>					
					<p>Here are a couple of wireframe, focusing on layouts, for single widget views or multiple widget views. The goal was to figure out how single or multiple widgets can be displayed on the screen and what types of information can be fit into widget space.</p>
					<p>The main challenge was to figure out how to show the widgets without competing for attention away from the TV programs. We wanted to extend the TV viewing experience but did not want to take over the focus from watching TV. Should the TV content be resized or should the widgets be semi-transparent?</p>					
					<div id="simplegallery2"></div>					
				</div></div>
				
				<div id='phase_2c' class='content'><div class='content_style'>
					<p><h3>Stage 3: Narrowing Down Options for Layouts</h3></p>	
					<p>After exploring alternative designs, we narrowed down to three: icon layout, regular layout, small layout. Icon layout shows multiple widgets icons. Regular layout provides ~1/4 of screen for a single widget and small layout provides ~1/8 of screen for a single widget.</p>

					<p>Having a pretty good idea of the layouts we want, I started prototyping on the STB. The STB renders through a WebKit browser. The browser is relatively old and doesn't support CSS3 & HTML5. For example, everyone wanted the widgets to have rounded corners but cannot set them using CSS. Therefore, if you look closely in regular and small Layout, the corners are not rounded for that reason.</p>

					<p>Customized JQuery themes are used for the platform and widgets. This allowed me to focus more on prototyping the layout and key handling interactions.</p>

					<p><h3>Developing Sample Widgets</h3></p>
					<p>My team and I all developed different sample widgets on the platform. It was very helpful for debugging as well as improving features and interactions.</p>
					
					<p><h3>Developing Companion Devices</h3></p>
					<p>In addition to developing on the STB, I also created a web application called adVenture which extended beyond TV. adVenture detects products from metadata of the TV content and offers product deals. User can get the deals on TV and receive it on their desktop or mobile phone. The authentication between STB and adVenture is done through SMS. </p>
											
					<p><h3>Supporting Student Development</h3></p>	
					<p>The platform was available to students during 2010 Fall and 2011 Spring semesters. The team wrote detailed documentation for API, key handling, interaction, and layout. We also supported them throughout their projects.</p>	
				
					<p><h3>Evaluation</h3></p>	
					<ul>
						<li>Student Preferences - Regular, Small & Icon Views</li>	
						<li>Remote Control Key Handling Difficult Concept</li>																			
					</ul>
										
					<p>The students were able to create widgets on our platform for their projects. Many prefer to use regular, small and icon views only and skipped ticker view completely. In addition, some students had difficulty defining good interactions using the remote control. </p>

					<p><h3>Research Question</h3></p>
					<p>I decided to research about touchscreen for the visually impaired because I am interested in multimodal interactions as well as accessibility. </p>	
					<p>Touchscreen accessibility for the visually impaired users is challenging because there is no tactile controls. From speaking with the visually impaired community, many enjoy objects that provide ample tactile control. Therefore, I wanted to know if users would prefer to use tactile control over the existing gesture control.</p>

					<p><h3>Creating the Study</h3></p>	
					<ul>
						<li>Performances Vs. Preferences</li>
						<li>Qualitative & Quantitative Data</li>
						<li>Within-Subject Study On Hierarchical Menu</li>																						
					</ul>
										
					<p>In order to compare two different types of control style, I had to figure out a way to create a solid study. The study should be designed in such way that it would allow me to collect both quantitative and qualitative data about user preferences and performances.</p>
					<p>I decided to create a study where the users have to navigate through a hierarchical menu. The user have to navigate through a hierarchical menu to search for target items. The study was within-subject so that a user needed to navigate the menu using both conditions: gesture and tactile. Through this, I collected user's performance through task completion time as well as their subjective preferences through questionnaires.</p>
					<p><h3>Designing the Interactions</h3></p>	
					<p>Below are images of interactions for each condition. I created these using Omnigraffle. </p>

					<p><h3>Creating the Hierarchal Menu</h3></p>						
					<p>The hierarchical menu is a simple shopping category that is modeled after popular commerce website including Wal-Mart/Amazon.</p>					
					<p><h3>Implementing on iPad</h3></p>						
					<p>I decided to implement the prototype on iPad because it has very good API for gestures and multitouch. For this part, I learned Objective-C (I had a little experience previously but never implemented a full prototype). Although Apple's documentation was moderately helpful, I found a lot of good online tutorials that helped me with the implementation.</p>

					<p><h3>Calculating the Quantitative Data</h3></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Six Participants, 1hr Each</li>
						<li>Average Time: Gesture-42.25s, Tactile-47.19s</li>
						<li>Learning Curve Between 1st and 2nd Condition</li>																						
					</ul>										
					<p>I went through the study with six participants from the Center for Visually Impaired at Atlanta. They range from age 20s-50s. On average, there is a ~+20% learning curve between 1st and 2nd condition. Four successfully complete the entire study. The Average completion time from the participants were 42.25s for gesture and 47.19s for tactile. </p>
					<p><h3>Analyzing the Qualitative Data</h3></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Participants With Diabetes</li>
						<li>Problem with Tactile Control</li>
						<li>Difficulty in Learning the Hierarchical Menu</li>																						
					</ul>					
					<p>Most users preferred the gesture control. One told me after the study that he is more comfortable with gesture because he has problem with the tactile control. It turned out that this participant had diabetes and one of the symptoms is losing sense of touch.</p>
					<p>Through this study, I conclude that although tactile control can be helpful for visually impaired users for many tasks, gesture control is actually more powerful for them to use touchscreen.</p>							
					<p><img src="./user_preferences.png" /></p>	
					<p><h3>Providing Guidelines</h3></p>							
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Physical buttons should be for quick tasks/shortcuts</li>
							<li>Physical buttons should be small and easy to find</li>
							<li>Gestures provide quick navigation</li>
							<li>Better to remember different gestures than spent time looking for physical (tactile) buttons</li>
							<li>Combination should be the best</li>
						</ul>
