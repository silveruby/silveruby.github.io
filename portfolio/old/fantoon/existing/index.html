 	<header><h2>Twitter</h2></header>
	<!-- <p>Twitter is used to get instant updates from everyone. The updates are in forms of 140 characters. It is powerful and effective because it is simple and easy to understand. Also, it gives instant gratification for those who needs to be kept updated every second.</p> -->
	<section>
		<header><h3>Splash Page</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>Twitter has it right by introducing their service at the splash. Immediately, it invites you to search for twits on its search box. The design metaphor of birds, twittering and following something is used throughout the site. The twitter logo is followed by a bird. The verb used in the caption is 'Follow' and the background is a map. Though, I think if they want to push the design metaphor, they can make the background into a tree also. </li>
				<li>The Sign In and Sign Up options are also on the splash page. This is wonderful because 25% of the users don't like splash page because it is completely filled with graphic. Not inviting at all. Yet in this case, the splash page invites the users to join or continue using the service.</li>
				<li>This section of the page is very unique and useful. It gives users an immediate glance at what they can follow using profile images of different accounts.</li>
			</ol>

	<section>
		<header><h3>Home Page</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>The top navigation menu is always a good design. It gives user a glance of popular options.</li>
				<li>The menu that focuses on the twits themselves provide options for users. Timeline is very important as twits are expected to be real time updates.</li>
				<li>Users get recommendation through what they follow. It not only tells users what is recommended, it also explains how the recommendation came about. This is very useful and informative. Another social media network, Youtube, also lets their users know how the recommendation was suggested. </li>
				<li>Everything specific to the user such as account settings are listed under this cute mini user profile icon and name drop down menu. I think this is much more effective than, say, Facebook's boring account drop down menu. </li>

	<section>
		<header><h3>Splash Page</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>This is advertising one of Facebook's products. Good but it doesn't introduce new users to what Facebook does. However, since it is so popular, maybe they thought there is no need to do so?</li>
				<li>Sign In and Sign Up options should always be available right on splash page. [Twitter, Splash-2]</li>

	<section>
		<header><h3>Home Page</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>No category label, i.e.- Groups and Applications. Requires users to process the information, which is not good.</li>
				<li>The notification icon is addictive, especially when you get updates. The red background plus number of updates are informative to the users.</li>
				<li>A simple 'Edit' will do instead of 'Edit My Profile'</li>	
				<li>News Feed on the home/front page optimizes connection with friends.</li>
				<li>News Feed should focus on your connections. Users generally don't post their own stuff on News Feed. However, this may be a way to encourage more contribution?</li>
				<li>Upcoming Events such as birthday and invitations are good but the Calendar Icon is confusing. 31? It could be confusing. However, the time of the event, Tomorrow, is informative.</li>
				<li>Home and profile is redundant. It can already be accessed on the top-left corner of the page. Account drop down is acceptable but I prefer twitter's display more. [Twitter, Home-4]</li>

		<header><h3>Connection Page</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>The profile image is not consistent in size and format as it is in the home page.</li>
				<li>Good use of page marker on the side though I think it could be larger and obvious.</li>
				<li>This is a simple alphabetical list of friends. I think it could add in a few more options to sort the list. </li>
				<li>Information about friends is good to have when you're on this page. However, I think the 'People You May Know' should be on top. </li>
				<li>Edit friends options should be available on the page itself. It does not need another page. I arrived at this page through clicking on my friends list from the profile. If I clicked on the 'Friends' tab on the left side, it actually gives me a different page. Very confusing. </li>

 	<header><h2>Google+</h2></header>
	<section>
		<header><h3>Splash Page</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>Doesn't tell users what Google+ is for. Should use Verb as beginning of the sentence.</li>	
				<li>Does not have Sign In or Sign Up fields available on the splash page.</li>

		<header><h3>Home Page</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>Instead of News Feed, Google+ uses Stream to keep users updated with their connections. This is good way of segmenting information.</li>
				<li>This explanation section is helpful but it should have been available in the splash page. However, it is still good example of explaining how to use this new social network by providing its best services.</li>				
				<li>Top Navigation bar is simple and uncluttered. Centered-aligned is a plus.</li>		
				<li>Profile popup is good. I think it can be seen as a user badge.</li>	
				<li>Again, notification icon. [Facebook, Home-2]</li>

				<li>The home page of Twitter, Facebook and Google+ all have recent news feeds as central point. However, Twitter news feeds are text focused, Facebook and Google+ are connection focused. For Fantoon, it should be Interest focused. </li>	
				<li>Recommendation should be available on this page as well. In most cases, on the right hand side.</li>

		<header><h3>Other Thoughts</h3></header>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li>Design Metaphor need to focus on graphs and connections. One way of doing so would use nodes to represent interests and users that make up that node. And then display this idea visually.</li>	
				<li>What distinguishes between Fantoon and other social network is its focus on Interests. Therefore, user postings (ideas, videos, images) should be done for a specific interest. As mentioned previously, the News Feed needs to focus on streaming interests updates rather than user updates.</li>											
						<li>
							In addition, I also think that neither of these social networks have design user identification beyond username. It would be nice to try a badge design because I think this could add to user experience.
