	<section>
		<p><a href="http://www.onewire.com">OneWire</a> is a website that focuses on matching people with new financial career opportunities. 
			I was hired as their 2nd User Experience Designer with the goal to increase user conversions (getting more sign-ups from both job-seekers and employers).  
			My main responsibilities were <strong>designing and prototyping</strong> new features for the site.  </p>
			<p>Both the development team and product team worked together using the scrum process.</p>

		<section>
			<p>My biggest project at the company was redesigning the public site. I worked with stakeholders to <strong>identify content assets and created overall content strategy</strong>.</p>
			<p>At the prototyping phase, I took the role as <strong>front-end developer and implemented the HTML, CSS and Javascript</strong> for prototypes and the actual production release.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples of early interactive HTML prototypes: 
				<ul>
					<li><a href="./prototypes-candidates/prototypes1.html">Interactive prototype 1</a> (use left and right arrow keys)</li>
					<li><a href="./prototypes-candidates/prototypes2.html">Interactive prototype 2</a> (click on employers or candidates)</li>
				</ul>
