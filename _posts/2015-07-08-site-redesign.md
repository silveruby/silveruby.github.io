About three months ago, I pushed the current design of this site. This post is long overdue, though I want to capture my thoughts and process anyways.  A combination of personal and technical needs inspired the redesign — I wanted to have a portfolio and a blog that’s easily managed. Considering all the options and deciding on a blogging framework was the hardest task, simply because I felt all the popular options such as WordPress etc. did not suit my needs. Eventually, I decided Jekyll would be the best solution as it offered a highly customizable and lightweight framework. It’s not a CMS but a static site generator but I think with simple blog posts once a few year, it doesn’t need a fully functional CMS. 

Once the framework is selected, my next step was asking questions like “what do I want to communicate to my visitors?” and “who am I communicating with?” I think this is an important step as it will shape the entire experience of the site. What I’ve seen in a lot of re-design project is that people tend to focus on features or trend rather than the messages and content. And this, is a tragedy as the the most worst thing that can happen in website redesign is when everything looks great, but it doesn’t have a central messages and well defined core contents. 

The first question I tackled was “who am I communicating with?” My best guess was the site visitors would be potential employers, acquaintances and friends. Employers would want to know my work experience and see my portfolio, and  presumably, my acquaintances and friends would want to get to know me a little bit more. With careful consideration, I decided make employers my primary target users and friends secondary target users.  As a result, the landing page is a portfolio page for employers and the blog is tugged away on the top right navigation bar. 

Once I’ve defined the audiences, my next step was figuring out what I want to communicate to them. Well, for potential employers, I want to let them know my work experiences and what I can do for them.  As I have both technical and design skills, I struggled to define myself with only one job title. I decided to avoid using User Experience Designer, despite my last two jobs had the title UX Designer, because through work experience, I observed that the job title conveys different skill sets to people. Oftentimes, employers would mistaken UX for visual design positions. While I enjoy providing design input, I am much more interested in figuring out technical implementations and problem solving, than obsessing over pixels and colors.

As I tried to figure out where I fell within the UX spectrum, I read a fantastic article called the UX Design Practice Vertical. I think it is highly clear and insightful about different UX roles. On the landing page, I used a bit of practice vertical terms and draw out what I loved to do — front-end development, information architecture, interaction design and accessibility. 

For my secondary target users, I created two sections, blog and connect, for people to get to know me more.  

Finally, I’ve been in love with Google Material Design so followed many guidelines from it.
