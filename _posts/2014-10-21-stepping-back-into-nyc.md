Early Monday morning this week, I packed a bag of clothes for 4 days, and took the Acela Express from Boston to Manhattan.  The train arrived around 10AM and immediately I felt the rushing city energy as I stepped onto the station platform. I emerged onto 34th street and swirled in all directions as I tried to orient myself towards the PATH station. Left or Right? Oh Wait, East or West? My foot moved on their own before I could wrap my mind around what was happening. There’s no time to think, gotta keep moving! 

A year ago, I escaped the city because it was too much for me - the people, energy, competition, expectation, believes and everything. Therefore, it definitely felt strange to be back in the city for work. Although I've lived in the Midwest and South, these places were nothing compared to the Big Apple where people are constantly on survival mode and everything is speed up 2-4x. My experience here was compressed and intense, and I barely had any time to breath. I felt I was never going to thrive in the city so I escaped after 2 years. 

Sometimes I think my life could’ve been ‘better’ now had I sought a stable job in a mid-size city rather than NYC when I finished grad school. I would’ve at least saved money instead of squandering them away in rent, food and mindless shopping sprees. However, I don't really regret my time in NYC because I learned so much about myself and the world. Yes I had my heart broken a few times and made some silly career decisions, but I wouldn’t trade these experiences with anything else.

When I was in elementary school in China, I  learned how to recite "Quiet Night Thought" by Li Bai — it is a poem that paints a traveler's nostalgia for home. When I came to American, the first poem I remember learning was “The Road Not Taken” by Robert Frost. At the moment, I feel more connected with this poem about travel than the first poem about home. I don’t miss home because I haven't found a place to call home yet. But, I have chosen a path. While I do wonder sometimes if I should’ve taken a different path, in the end, it probably doesn’t really matter. Life is best when it is full of adventures and surprises.
