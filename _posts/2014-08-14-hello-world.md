Blogging has always been a helpful way for me to organize my thoughts. My first blog was created on [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) in 2001. From then on, I've tried numerous blogging platforms such as [Xanga](http://xanga.com/), Pitas (now Diaryland), [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) and many more. In 2004, when I was about a year into college, I stopped blogging due to personal conflicts. One exception was that I did keep an online travel journal when I was studying abroad in Japan for 3 months - [rubyinjapan2006.wordpress.com](http://rubyinjapan2006.wordpress.com).

For ten years, between 2004-2014, I tried many times to start blogging again, but somehow I was never happy with any of the blogging platforms and got caught up in the micro-blogging craze. I used Twitter, Tumblr, and even Facebook, but again, none of them really felt like the right tool for me. I felt all of them are too curt and oftentimes too mindless for me to use. Therefore, I ditched micro-blogging after a few years and begun my search for a beautiful light-weight customizable CMS.

The most common blogging CMS is WordPress. It is widely used by people and frankly, I have no fucking idea why. It is an over-bloated platform with way too many unnecessary features for simple blogging needs. I wanted something minimal that wold load fast and be easy to maintain; Wordpress satisfied neither. Over the years, I tested out a few other CMSs but never found the right now until I came across [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) when I was playing with Github Pages. 

The light-weight static site generator provided exactly the simplicity and flexibility I was looking for. I really like Jekyll and feel this is the best way to blog. There are a lot of fantastic resources for Jekyll blogs. This [article on how to create a simple blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) was helpful read. I liked how simple it is to add extra features such as Disqus comments and Google Analytics on the website. In addition, I found this [article on how to maintain tags](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/). 

Anyways, I'm excited to be blogging again. I plan to use this blog as a method to explore and document my interests and passions. Some common topics I want to focus on will be programming, travel, minimalism, and spiritual musings.
