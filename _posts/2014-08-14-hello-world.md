Blogging has always been a way to help me organize my thoughts and share them with the world. The first time I blogged was back in 2001 using [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com). Since then, I've used numerous other blogging platforms such as [Xanga](http://xanga.com/), Pitas (now Diaryland), [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/). 

I stopped blogging a year into undergraduate school due to personal issues. Although I tried to pick it up a few times since then, it was hard for me to be consistent because of the rise of micro-blogging. I couldn't decide if I should use micro-blogging platforms or pick one of many blogging platforms. 

I tried to get into micro-blogging using services such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/), but this method never felt right. It is too curt and oftentimes mindless for me. So, after ditching the micro-blogging idea, I researched different blogging CMS and experienced analysis paralysis for years (and sadly, this is a common theme in my life). 

The most common blogging CMS is WordPress. It is widely used by people and frankly, I have no fucking idea why. It is an over-bloated platform with way too many unnecessary features for my simple blogging needs. I wanted something minimal that loads fast and easy to maintain. Wordpress satisfied neither of them. 

I tested out a few other CMSs but never found the right now until I came across [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) when I was playing with Github Pages. The light-weight static site generator offered just the things I needed and none of the excessive crap. 

There are a lot of fantastic resources for Jekyll blogs. This [article on how to create a simple blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) was helpful read. I liked how simple it is to add extra features such as Disqus comments and Google Analytics on the website. In addition, I found this [article on how to maintain tags](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/). 

After being dormant for a couple of years, I'm excited to be blogging again. I plan to use blogging as a method to explore and document my interests and passions. Some common topics that I'll focus on will be user experience design, technology, art, travel, minimalism, herbalism, and spiritual practices.
