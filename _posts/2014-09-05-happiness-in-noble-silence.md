Last weekend, I went to the [Won Dharma Center in upstate New York](http://www.wondharmacenter.org/) for a Labor Day weekend retreat. My friend and I drove to the center on Friday afternoon and arrived just in time for dinner. There were a mix of people in the dinning hall, all ready to partake in a 3-days meditation. As I sat in the dinning hall, I felt gentle and welcoming energy from everyone and quickly settled with the surrounding.

This retreat was something I desperately needed. For the past few weeks, I felt frustrated and stressed out with life. My mind was constantly raced like a honey bee buzzing from one flower to another, except it had no nectar to gather. I was running low on energy and needed to recharge. 

Being surrounded by nature and people with good intentions helped me step back and find my inner peace. One of the rules during the retreat was Noble Silence. Under Noble Silence, we had to refrain from speaking with each other with only necessary words spoken. This technique focuses on present moments and creates space to allow us to look deeply into ourselves. No words. Silence. And during the night, only sounds of gentle wind and night critters. 

I loved keeping Noble Silence. Whenever I passed another person, I simply smiled at them and continued on without interruption in my mind. As my mind became free from others' needs and expectation, I felt present with the late summer flowers (Golden Rod, Queen Ann's Lace and Red Clover), the taste and smell of delicious food, and the simple joy of being alive.

When Noble Silence ended in the final day, I felt anxiety and panic arise. It was difficult coming out of silence and talking with people. While I truly appreciated the people at the retreat, I did not feel comfortable connecting with them using words. Words are constructs of expectation and judgement. "What do you do? Where are you from? How did you get here?" Do these conversations matter? I felt the common experiences we had shared during the retreat were much stronger than idle words we exchanged at the end of the retreat.
