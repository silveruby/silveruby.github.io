We are born into this world to connect with ourselves and others. There are many ways to connect. For me, I feel most connected to someone through his or her artworks. It is an amazing feeling to be able to see and recognize the gentle sensitivity in others just by looking at their paintings, photographs or any art forms. 

One of my favorite artists is Constantin Brâncuși. He is a Romanian artist who lived in France and considered one of the pioneers of Modernism. When I saw his sculpture "The Newborn", I felt a familiar tug on my soul. It is a very simple sculpture yet perfectly communicates elegance and balance of life. 

A similar feeling occurred when I saw photographs of a place I've visited from an acquaintance. I didn't know this person very well and it surprised me when I felt he perfectly captured my feelings and experiences of that place.  How do you tell someone whom you barely know that you have such strong connection to his art? I wanted to grab his hands and shout "oh my gosh, these are amazing! I feel the same way you do! Tell me more about your feelings and thoughts! I really want to connect with you!" Yet, all I said to him was something like "you're really good at taking pictures."

I feel sad I never found the opportunity to connect with him. Life is cruel. Even though I felt such strong connection with this person, he never reciprocated my feelings. But it's ok, this motivates me to find myself even more. I think the reason why I am having trouble connecting with people is because I am lost as to who I am and where I want to go. 

Perhaps, what I really need to do right now is to connect with myself... To express and capture my world through art.
