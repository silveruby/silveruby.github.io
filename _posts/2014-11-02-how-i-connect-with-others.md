There are many ways to connect with others. While most people prefer to connect with people by talking to them, for me, I love to connect with people through the works they create - be it art, photographs, writings or even programming codes. I love to look at a piece of work and be able to see the gentle sensitivity, patience and hard-work that were put into it by its owner. To me, that says everything about a person's inner feelings and thoughts.  

One of my favorite artists is Constantin Brâncuși. He is a Romanian artist who lived in France and considered one of the pioneers of Modernism. When I saw his sculpture "The Newborn", I felt a familiar tug at my soul and shiver down my spine. It is a very simple sculpture yet somehow it perfectly communicated all the elegance and balance of life. Although I have not had the opportunity to see it in person, even in pictures, I am captivated by its beauty. 

A similar feeling resurfaced when I saw photographs from an acquaintance. I didn't know this person very well and barely spoke to him, so I was really surprised to see his photographs and felt my soul instantly pulled by them.  I wanted to grab his hands and shout "oh my gosh, these are amazing! My soul is moved by your work!" But how odd would it be if I express such intense feeling toward a stranger? I was too afraid to find out so all I ended up saying to him was something like "you're really good at taking pictures."

It's interesting to point out that while I strongly feel and marvel at works of many people, these people are rarely in my life. Because I value their works so much, I oftentimes become speechless and scared in their presence. Yet, I continue to seek out their works because my soul feels alive and validated through them.
